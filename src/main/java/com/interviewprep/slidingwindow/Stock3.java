    *  You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

    Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

    Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).



        Example 1:

        Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
        Output: 6
        Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
        Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
